# Spacecraft Simulation README

## Introduction

Welcome to the Spacecraft Simulation project README. This project aims to simulate the behavior of a spacecraft over a period of time, considering factors such as velocity, acceleration, distance, and fuel consumption. The simulation is performed using JavaScript code.

## Struggles

### 1. Handling Units and Conversions
One of the main struggles was handling different units for parameters such as velocity, acceleration, and duration. Ensuring that all calculations were performed using consistent units posed a challenge.

### 2. Error Handling
Implementing robust error handling to deal with invalid input parameters and unit mismatches was another challenge. It required careful consideration to ensure the code could gracefully handle errors without crashing.

### 3. Understanding the Requirements
Understanding the requirements thoroughly and ensuring that the code met all the specified criteria was a key struggle. It required careful reading and interpretation of the given parameters and expected corrected results.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Importance of Unit Consistency
This project highlighted the importance of unit consistency in calculations. It taught me the significance of converting all parameters to a common unit before performing any mathematical operations to ensure accurate results.

### 2. Error Handling Best Practices
Implementing robust error handling mechanisms taught me the importance of anticipating potential issues and providing clear error messages to aid debugging and troubleshooting.

### 3. Clear Communication
Clear communication of requirements and expectations is crucial for successful project completion. It's essential to clarify any ambiguities upfront and ensure alignment between stakeholders.

## Goals

### 1. Implement Accurate Calculations
The primary goal was to implement accurate calculations for velocity, distance, and remaining fuel consumption based on the provided parameters and expected corrected results.
